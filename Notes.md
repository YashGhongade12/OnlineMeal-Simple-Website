            <li class="item"><a href=""></a></li>
            <li class="item"><a href=""></a></li>

here I will not use a float I will use a flexbox latest techquies kala ka bhau..  It will make our work easy kala ka bhau..
and we will also remove the underline of a anchor tag with text-decoration and also remove the disc of ul by style none kala ka bhau so lets apply it bro kala ka bhau..

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"> = For to access a style.css all properties kala ka bhau..

A CSS reset is a set of styles applied to a webpage to normalize and remove default browser styles. It helps create a consistent baseline for styling, minimizing variations across different browsers and allowing developers to start with a clean slate for their designs.

bcoz of flexbox it becomes easy to make in a street row otherwise in old technologies becomes really hard bro kala ka bhau..

img tag inside a logo id this is the meaning kala ka bhau..
#logo img {
     
}

If u didnt understand padding margin height width inside a logo and img tag inside a logo then change the value by hovering it on inspect kala ka bhau..then u can get a clarity of it ok,that set.

Always keep the less margin on Y-axis bcoz if y axis margin is very big the cursor pointer hovering gets problems mng kasa ahai margin var hover kela tare pointer ynr cursor pointer set kelay var kala ka bhau..So,Always keep it in mind bro nahi kala tr faktha lakshat thev ki y-axis che margin kami thevayche bhau kala ka bhau..

In olden times when flexbox is not their the problems comes in a developer they done a navbar using a position and float kala ka bhau but now using a flexbox it become easy bro kala ka bhau

#navbar ul li a {} = Why i have give select a anchor tag present inside a li and li present inside a ul and ul in id=navbar why i have select like this karan ki jar pe kutlay particular anchor tag var hover kela na bhau tr tu faktha particular anchor tag cha hover zala pahejel bhau kala ka bhau..nahi kala tr vedio of this tutorials parat bagh bhau nahitr de sodun bhau kala ka bhau..So,for hovering purpose i have done it so it will select all anchor tags inside a ul of all list items li tags kala ka bhau..and we can apply a hovering effect to a each and every anchor element particularlly on hovering and same property for all anchor tags kala ka bhau..

Sometimes its better not to know all things kala ka bhau faktha dokayt thevaycha bhau kala ka bhau..bcoz 90% grasping power is also more than sufficent kala ka bhau..

In CSS, the z-index property is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements. A z-index value of -1 means that the element should be positioned one level behind the normal flow of elements.

The CSS code #navbar { position: relative; } indicates that the element with the ID "navbar" will have a position property set to relative. When an element is given a position: relative; style, it means that the positioning of the element will be relative to its normal position in the document flow.

Now we have to do a section below the nav and adding a background image id for section is home abhi navagation bar ka kaam khatam ho gaya bhai now lets jump on section id=home ok..lets do it

section#home + Enter = <section id="home"></section>
h1.h-primary + Enter = <h1 class="h-primary"></h1>
button.btn + Enter = <button class="btn"></button>

better to use a pseudo selector before to set a background image kala ka bhau be a professional developer kala ka bhau..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
url('../bg1.jpg'): This sets the background image for the element. It specifies the path to the image file, in this case, '../bg1.jpg'.

no-repeat: This specifies that the background image should not be repeated. It will be displayed only once.

center center: This sets the initial position of the background image. The first "center" refers to the horizontal position, and the second "center" refers to the vertical position. So, the background image will be centered both horizontally and vertically.

/cover: This is a background size property that instructs the browser to scale the background image as much as possible while maintaining its aspect ratio, so that it completely covers the entire background area. If the aspect ratio of the background image does not match the aspect ratio of the element, some parts of the background may be clipped.

In summary, the background property you provided sets a background image for an element, prevents it from repeating, centers it both horizontally and vertically, and ensures that it covers the entire background area of the element while maintaining its aspect ratio.

Utility classes in CSS are small, reusable classes designed for specific styling purposes, allowing quick application of styles without writing custom CSS for each element.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
padding: 12px; means from all side padding is 12px kala ka bhau..

In many text editors and word processors, the "Ctrl + Y" keyboard shortcut is commonly used to redo or repeat the last undone action. It is the opposite of "Ctrl + Z," which is used to undo the previous action. Keep in mind that the functionality of keyboard shortcuts can vary between different programs, so it's always a good idea to check the specific application's documentation for accurate information.

first make a phone.css folder in a css folder and add link in head tag just add a one attribute as media="screen and (max-width: 1100px)" it means that before the 1100px websites madhe problem yetoy je ke phone.css madhe add kelay var ynr nahi bhau kala ka bhau..Their are also a standards px for a responsive we can go through google also kala ka bhau for mobile tabs etc...

<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 1100px)" href="css/phone.css"> meaning is below ok

This HTML code snippet includes a link to an external stylesheet with the href attribute pointing to a file named "phone.css." The media attribute specifies that this stylesheet should only be applied when the screen width is less than or equal to 1100 pixels. In summary, it indicates that the "phone.css" stylesheet is designed for screens with a maximum width of 1100 pixels or less, suggesting a responsive design approach for mobile devices or smaller screens.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets start with a systematic way to build a responsive website kala ka bhau starting with seqential order

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CSS code #clients { overflow: hidden; } applies to the HTML element with the ID "clients." It sets the overflow property to "hidden," which means that any content overflowing the specified dimensions of the "clients" element will be hidden from view, and no scrollbar will appear to allow users to scroll through the hidden content. This is often used to contain and hide excess content within a defined area, ensuring it does not affect the layout or appearance of the surrounding elements.
responsive che size kami zale ki client section will hide no scroll bar will display..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Always follow the rem instead of px kala ka bhau be as a professional developer kala ka bhau..
Responsive madhe always give a preference to a padding and margin font-size etc..instead on giving a more focus on a height and width kala ka bhau...

The CSS property flex-wrap: wrap; is applied to a flex container, and it instructs the flex items to wrap onto multiple lines if they exceed the available space along the main axis. In other words, it allows flex items to move to a new row or column when there isn't enough space to fit them all in a single line.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In many web browsers, pressing "Ctrl + Shift + R" is a keyboard shortcut to perform a "hard refresh" or "force reload" of a web page. This action bypasses the browser cache and retrieves all the resources (such as stylesheets, scripts, and images) from the server, ensuring that the latest versions of these resources are loaded.

This can be useful in situations where you want to make sure you are viewing the most up-to-date version of a web page, especially during web development when changes to the site's assets may not be reflected due to caching.

The CSS property height: auto; is used to make an element's height automatically adjust based on its content. It allows the element to expand or shrink vertically to accommodate its internal content without specifying a fixed height. This is particularly useful when the content inside the element varies in height, as it ensures the container adjusts dynamically to fit its content. Also to maintain the image quality kala ka bhau..in responsive as well as in desktop it will automatically arrange the height kala ka bhau..so this CSS property is very much useful bro kala ka bhau..Ok,That Set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CSS rule #navbar { position: sticky; } is used to make the navbar element have a "sticky" positioning behavior. This means that the navbar will remain in its normal flow position within the document until it reaches a specified scroll point. Once it reaches that point during scrolling, it will become "sticky" and stay fixed in place relative to the viewport, providing a persistent navigation element as the user scrolls down the page. means websites scroll kela tare navbar tethalay tethacha rahanar bhau kala ka bhau..that is the power of position: sticky;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So,Finally we have completed a responsive websites with sticky navbar kala ka bhau..and lets upload on github also kala ka bhau ok,that set.not a best website in the world but it is a best responsive website for me kala ka bhau Ok,That Set.

<li class="item"><a href="#home">Home</a></li> "meaning in few lines"

This HTML code represents a list item (<li>) with a class attribute set to "item." Within this list item, there is a hyperlink (<a>) with an "href" attribute pointing to the anchor with the ID "home" (presumably an element elsewhere in the HTML document). This construct is commonly used for navigation, indicating a list item named "Home" that, when clicked, directs the user to the section or element with the ID "home" on the same page. same fot others Our Clients,Contact Us,Services,Home Just see and figure it out the meaning kala ka bhau Ok,That Set.
